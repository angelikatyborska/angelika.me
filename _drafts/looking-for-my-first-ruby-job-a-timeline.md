I would like to share with you my experience with looking for my first Ruby job. I want to focus mainly on the timeline of the whole process. Before I started, I was under the impression that everyone would answer my emails within 24 hours. Boy was I wrong... This post is to let you know how redious the recruitment process can be. To calm your nerves.

## Prologue - a kick in the butt

I had been wanting to work for Company X ever since I heard a short presentation from their employee about how awesome Ruby and Rails are, in October 2014. It was an event organized at my University for students that wanted to become back-end developers, but weren't sure with language and framework to choose. The guy presenting Java & Spring was muscular, elegant, well-prepared and not very relatable. The PHP & Symphony guy wasn't very convinced about his choice himself. The Python & Django guy had a giant stage fright and kept mispronouncing 'Ruby' (polish developers have this awful manner to pronounce it like /ˈræbi/). The Ruby & Rails guy was relaxed, natural and had very pretty slides. I was sold. I wanted to be like him. 

**11-12 December 2015:** I attend a RoR workshop at Company X (required for an internship).

**19 December 2015:** I applied for an internship at Company X.

**29 December 2015:** I got a rejection email form Company X (with feedback).

I was not prepared for a failure. In fact, I haven't experienced many big failures up until this point of my life. Actually, this rejection was very important to me. It motivated me to start working really hard on a portfolio app (after two or three days of self-loathing). 

## Part I

**04 February 2016:** I applied for an internship at Company A in a response to a job offer.

**09 February 2016:** I applied for a junior position at Company B in a response to a job offer that has been on their website forever.

**16 February 2015:** I applied for a position (level not specified) at Company C in a response to a job offer with a deadline.

## Part II - lost hope

I have been gradually going crazy. Why isn't anyone replying? I triple-checked my resume, the email address was correct, my phone number was correct. I triple-checked my sent mailbox. I did in fact sent my applications.



## Part III - a spark of hope

## Epilogue

## Conclusion
Be patient. Don't obsess over one application. Keep learning.
