Last week I published a new side project, [The Nonvisual Website](https://nonvisualwebsite.com/).

It's a static website whose content can only be easily accessed with a [screen reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader).
The content is visually hidden. DOM modifications aren't allowed, so you cannot remove the styles that hide the content.
The HTML is obfuscated, so it's tedious to try to read the source to figure out what's hidden there. Even the JavaScript source is obfuscated.

**Why would I create such a thing?**

Out of anger. Anger at the web development industry and the individuals and organizations within it that again and again fail to recognize and take responsibility for the digital exclusion that their web development practices cause.

The first time I felt that anger was when Duolingo stopped working on my mom's older laptop, which meant she could no longer learn English that way.
The most recent time I felt it was when [a certain tool from a high-profile company was released that claimed to be production-ready, yet completely ignored web accessibility](https://hidde.blog/interactions-about-accessibility/).

But I don't want to spread anger, I don't want to be preachy, and I don't want to shame anyone. Those tactics do not produce positive results in most cases.

I want to help spread awareness and educate. But I'm not an accessibility specialist, and I'm not a charismatic speaker either. But I'm a web developer and I can make weird websites.

I hope the visitors to [The Nonvisual Website](https://nonvisualwebsite.com/) experience two things:
**a realization that alternative methods of accessing the web exist,
and the curiosity to try out one of them**.

If you have no idea where to start, grab your smartphone, turn on TalkBack (Android) or VoiceOver (iOS), and follow the tutorial that your phone has for you.
