All the below examples were written for PostgreSQL.

Let's say I want to model a directory structure like this one:

```
.
└── Angelika
    ├── .vim
    │   └── bundle
    ├── Documents
    └── Pictures
```

The directory `.vim` is a hidden directory. For the sake of this example, I will mark that with a `hidden` flag instead of assuming the naming convention with the dot.

I create this table for directories:

```sql
CREATE TABLE directories (
  id serial NOT NULL,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  parent_id int,
  hidden bool NOT NUlL,
  PRIMARY KEY(id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_parent_id
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id)
    REFERENCES directories (id)
);
```

I insert data representing the directory tree from above:

```sql
INSERT INTO
  directories (id, name, hidden, parent_id)
VALUES
  (1, 'Angelika', false, null),
  (2, '.vim', true, 1),
  (3, 'bundle', false, 2),
  (4, 'Documents', false, 1),
  (5, 'Pictures', false, 1);
```

## Read a recursive property

Let's say I need to display a tree of directories but exclude the hidden ones and their children.

I am going to define a `show` property. I want to show a directory only if it is not hidden and all of its ancestors are not hidden. Below this definition as a Ruby method:

```ruby
def show?(directory)
  !directory.hidden &&
    (directory.parent == nil || show?(directory.parent))
end
```

It is also possible to define exactly the same logic in a SQL query.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE tree AS
(
  SELECT
    id,
    name,
    parent_id,
    NOT hidden AS show
  FROM
    directories
  WHERE
    parent_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    directory.id,
    directory.name,
    directory.parent_id,
    (
      NOT(directory.hidden)
      AND parent.show
    )
  FROM
    directories directory
    JOIN
      tree parent
      ON directory.parent_id = parent.id
)
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  parent_id
FROM
  tree
WHERE
  show = TRUE;
```

### Explanation

The query is split into two parts. The first part is a `WITH RECURSIVE` statement that builds a temporary results table for further use with the (arbitrarily chosen) name `tree`. This first part is split into two sub-parts, a non-recursive term, and a recursive term. The second part is an ordinary `SELECT` statement using the result produced by the first part.

```sql
-- general shape
WITH RECURSIVE tree AS
(
  -- (...) - non-recursive term
  UNION ALL
  -- (...) -recursive term
)
SELECT
  -- (...) - your typical select
;
```

#### Non-recursive term

The terminal condition, in this case, is when a directory has no parent (`parent_id IS NULL`). `show` is then simply equal to `NOT hidden`.

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  name,
  parent_id,
  NOT hidden AS show
FROM
  directories
WHERE
  parent_id IS NULL
```

I need to select all other columns that I might want to use later, but the minimum, in this case, is the `id`, as it's needed to join on in the recursive term.

#### Recursive term

In this part, I select from the original `directories` table joined with the recursive temporary `tree` result on the parent-child relation (`directory.parent_id = parent.id`). The order of selected columns needs to be the same as in the non-recursive part. The recursion is in the `NOT(directory.hidden) AND parent.show` statement.

```sql
SELECT
  directory.id,
  directory.name,
  directory.parent_id,
  (
    NOT(directory.hidden)
    AND parent.show
  )
FROM
  directories directory
  JOIN
    tree parent
    ON directory.parent_id = parent.id
```

## Update a node and its ancestors

Let's say I keep a timestamp of when a directory was last updated in a column called `updated_at`, and I define it as the last time when the directory was updated or any of its children were updated.

```sql
CREATE TABLE directories (
  id serial NOT NULL,
  name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  parent_id int,
  updated_at timestamp NOT NUlL,
  PRIMARY KEY(id),
  CONSTRAINT fk_parent_id
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id)
    REFERENCES directories (id)
);

INSERT INTO directories (id, name, updated_at, parent_id)
VALUES
  (1, 'Angelika', timestamp '2000-01-01T12:00:00Z', null),
  (2, '.vim', timestamp '2000-01-01T12:00:00Z', 1),
  (3, 'bundle', timestamp '2000-01-01T12:00:00Z', 2),
  (4, 'Documents', timestamp '2000-01-01T12:00:00Z', 1),
  (5, 'Pictures', timestamp '2000-01-01T12:00:00Z', 1);
```

If I want to update the timestamp for `Angelika/.vim/bundle` (`id = 3`), I need to update `Angelika/.vim` and `Angelika` as well.

It would be very easy to achieve that if I could get a list of the ids of all ancestors of `Angelika/.vim/bundle`:

```sql
UPDATE
  directories
SET
  updated_at = TIMESTAMP '2018-08-01T14:45:00Z'
WHERE
  id = 3 OR id IN -- ???
;
```

Here is how to produce a column with a list of all ancestor ids for directories:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE tree AS
(
  SELECT
    id,
    ARRAY[]::INT[] AS ancestor_ids
  FROM
    directories
  WHERE
    parent_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    directory.id,
    parent.ancestor_ids || directory.parent_id
  FROM
    directories directory
    JOIN
      tree parent
      ON directory.parent_id = parent.id
)
```

The terminal condition is, for every directory that has no parent, its `ancestor_ids` is an empty array of integers (`ARRAY[]::INT[] AS ancestor_ids`).

The recursive term is, for every directory, its `ancestor_ids` are its parent's `ancestor_ids` appended with its `parent_id`.

And the full query to recursively update `inserted_at` for the directory `/Angelika/.vim/bundle` (`id = 3`) is:
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE tree AS
(
  SELECT
    id,
    ARRAY[]::INT[] AS ancestor_ids
  FROM
    directories
  WHERE
    parent_id IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    directory.id,
    parent.ancestor_ids || directory.parent_id
  FROM
    directories directory
    JOIN
      tree parent
      ON directory.parent_id = parent.id
)
UPDATE
  directories
SET
  updated_at = TIMESTAMP '2018-08-01T14:45:00Z'
WHERE
  id = 3
  OR id IN
  (
    SELECT
      UNNEST(ancestor_ids)
    FROM
      tree
    WHERE
      id = 3
  )
;
```

### SQL Fiddle with this example

## Update a node and its children

Let's say I want to do soft deletes for my directories. This means flagging a record as deleted instead of actually deleting it. I'll do that with a `deleted_at` timestamp.

If I did regular deletes, I could rely on a foreign key constraint to do cascading deletes for me (SQL Fiddle with an example [here](http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17/3a99c/1)). With soft deletes, it's not as easy.

Let's say I'm deleting `/Angelika/.vim` (`id = 2`). I need to update `deleted_at` for all directories whose `id` is `2` or any of its ancestor ids is `2`. This means I am only interested in a subtree whose root node is the directory with `id = 2`, so my terminal condition is not `parent_id IS NULL`, but `id = 2`.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE tree AS
(
  SELECT
    id
  FROM
    directories
  WHERE
    id = 2
  UNION ALL
  SELECT
    directory.id
  FROM
    directories directory
    JOIN
      tree parent
      ON directory.parent_id = parent.id
)
UPDATE
  directories
SET
  deleted_at = TIMESTAMP '2018-08-01T14:45:00Z'
WHERE
  id IN
  (
    SELECT
      id
    FROM
      tree
  )
;
```
