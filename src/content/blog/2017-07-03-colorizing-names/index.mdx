I am building an app where the user can work on multiple projects, on multiple branches per project. The UI displays the name of the current branch in small white letters in the top left corner of the app, next to the project's name and the project's icon. Except for that, there is no quick and obvious way to tell on which branch the user is working, save for thinking long and hard about the actual contents of the project.

That's a quick recipe for an [Oscar-style mix-up caused by a poor visual representation of data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZSe4xVXHhI). Especially on a Monday morning.

And said mix-up already happened. Pre-first-coffee-of-the-day, I was greeted by a panicked user that thought all of her work from the day before was gone. It turned out she was just looking at a different branch.

Before that ever happens again, I decided to make it easier to notice the user is editing the project on the wrong branch. Since I do not have enough space to spare in the UI of that application to enlarge fonts, I chose to differentiate branches by assigning colors to them.

## Requirements

1. The same branch name needs to always have the same color.
2. The color should not be predictable in any obvious way (by the first letter, by the color of a similar phrase etc.)
3. The colors for anagrams should differ.
4. The colors for potential typos should differ.
5. The colors should vary in hue but have more-or-less the same perceived lightness as they would be always displayed on a dark background.

## Solution

I chose to operate on colors using [HSL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#hsl()_and_hsla()) as I find it a more human-friendly way to think about colors.

Hue is a value ranging from `0` to `360`. `0` is red, `120` is green, `180` is cyan, `270` is purple, and `360` is again red.

Saturation and lightness are values from `0%` to `100%`.

I created a small project to be able to see the generated colors as I work on the code. Link [at the end of this post](#source).

### Convert a string to a number

Converting a single character to a number is straight-forward. Every Unicode character has a decimal number assigned and it's easily retrievable in JavaScript with `'a'.charCodeAt(0)`.

What I need now is to use that to get a single number for the whole string. That is a task for a hash function. "Hash function" sounds like a fancy complicated term if you don't think about it, but if you do think about it, it is just a function that can take data of any size (say, strings with branch names that will differ in length) and transform it to data of fixed size (say, integers in a known range).

I tried a few different approaches to converting a string to a (positive) number. I then used that number to form a color.

To get hue:

```javascript
const maxHue = 360;
const hue = x % maxHue;
```

To get saturation:

```javascript
const baseSaturation = 70;
const saturation = baseSaturation + (x % 30);
```

Values chosen randomly because they looked good.

To get lightness:

```javascript
const baseLightness = 65;
const lightnessDelta = 10;
const lightnessHueCorrection = Math.sin(Math.PI * hue / (maxHue / 2));
const lightness = baseLightness + (
  -1 * Math.round(lightnessDelta * lightnessHueCorrection)
);
```

Notice that I am not randomizing the lightness. Instead, I am using the `sine` function to correct the lightness so that it is lower for hues that seem light (yellow - hue `60`) and higher for hues that seem dark (purple - hue `270`). Doing that simply with the `sine` function is not ideal (notice yellow is not `90`...), but it is good enough for my use case.

```javascript
function numberToColor(x) {
  // (...)
  return `hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%)`;
}
```

#### Sum

The first approach I tried is to sum all the codes:

```javascript
function add(string) {
  return string.split("")
    .reduce((acc, char) => (acc + char.charCodeAt(0)), 0)
}
```

##### Problems

###### 1. Consecutive strings are barely distinguishable

Caused by the (very reasonable) property of `hue` to assign similar numbers to similar colors - `90` is green, `91` is still green.

###### 2. Typos are barely distinguishable

See [1](#1-consecutive-strings-are-barely-distinguishable).

###### 3. Anagrams have the same color

Caused by the commutative property of addition: `x + y = y + x`.

#### Multiply

The second approach I tried is to multiply all the codes:

```javascript
function multiply(string) {
  return string.split("")
    .reduce((acc, char) => (acc * char.charCodeAt(0)), 1)
}
```

##### Problems

<BlogPostImage

###### 1. Consecutive single-character strings are barely distinguishable

[The same story as for summing](#1-consecutive-strings-are-barely-distinguishable), except the issue only appears for single-character strings.

###### 2. Anagrams have the same color

Caused by the commutative property of multiplication: `x * y = y * x`.

###### 3. ...except they don't?

With multiplication, I quickly go over [the maximum safe integer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) and run into floating-point rounding errors.

<BlogPostImage

  alt={'reaching numbers over maximum safe integer'}
  caption={"When the result of multiplication exceeds the maximum safe integer, the commutative property of multiplication is no longer a guarantee."}
/>

For addition, this wasn't a practical problem, as I would have to form a string consisting of the letter "a" repeated approximately `93 * 10^12` (`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER / 97`) times to exceed the safe limit. But for multiplication, it's enough to repeat "a" [`9` times](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log(97,+9007199254740991)).

#### djb2

After failing two times, I consulted a friend about my problem. He proposed the djb2 hashing algorithm - supposedly great for strings:

```javascript
function djb2(string) {
  return Math.abs(
    string.split("")
    .reduce(function(acc, char) {
      return ((acc << 5) + acc) + char.charCodeAt(0);
    }, 5381)
  );
}
```

Indeed, that one worked great! Except...

##### Problems

  alt={'A problem with the djb2 algorithm'}
  caption={"A problem with the djb2 algorithm"}
/>

###### 1. Consecutive single-character strings are barely distinguishable

:cry:

I decided to intuitively tweak the djb2 algorithm on my own to remove that linear growth of the hash with the linear growth of the character codes.

#### The Final Solution - djb2 squared

I decided to simply square the character code before doing anything with it:


```javascript
function djb2Square(string) {
  return Math.abs(
    string.split("")
    .reduce(function(acc, char) {
      return ((acc << 5) + acc) + Math.pow(char.charCodeAt(0), 2);
    }, 5381)
  );
}
```

#### No problems!
