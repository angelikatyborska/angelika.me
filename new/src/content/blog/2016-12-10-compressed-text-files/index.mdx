Theoretically, I had been aware that archiving and compressing are two separate matters, but still, when I first saw a `.gz` file that was **not** a `.tar.gz` file, I was surprised.

It was an old log file that contained some data I needed to `grep`. My first instinct? Decompress it, creating a new file, and then `grep` the new file.

That was completely unnecessary because `gzip` can print a decompressed file to the standard output instead. If I had bothered then to read the man pages of `gzip`, I would have known that. Fortunately, human interactions are an OK substitute for reading manuals - a coworker told me I can just use `zcat`.

Compression of text files is something that is certainly important when keeping around old log files. When I look into my `/var/log/` directory, I can see there are a lot of `.log.gz` and `.log.bz2` files. I want to know how to deal with those two types.

## `.gz`

`gzip` is a compression/decompression tool using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77). It deals with files with the extension `.gz`.

### Compress a file

This will create a new `karma-police.txt.gz` file:

```
$ gzip -k karma-police.txt
```

I'm using `-k` to **k**eep the original `karma-police.txt`. The default behavior of `gzip` is to delete the input file.

### Decompress a file

This will create a new `karma-police.txt` file:

```
$ gzip -dk karma-police.txt.gz
```

The `-d` flag means that the tool should decompress instead of compressing.

### Read a compressed file

This is **not** a useful way to do it:

```
$ cat karma-police.txt.gz
�+LXkarma-police.txt�QAN�0
                          ��s��~h�>`Z���&+�٪�z\H ��R�h&�g<9�.�KI�����`Q*���0Js�d��μ�ۍ+��
��I����՟�"Z��=t���ꕔ:�Qg�x.ΥM����                                                        ¨2L����Z�J����JL��;'��W$ѡ@jx�Y�12'HJ�.X�k��^�FW��t!�-��}��5�a+

                                          "�angelika at MBP in ~
```

On Linux, there is a tool called `zcat` that allows reading `.Z` and `.gz` files. On Mac OS X, it does not work for `.gz` files:

```
$ zcat karma-police.txt.gz
zcat: can't stat: karma-police.txt.gz (karma-police.txt.gz.Z): No such file or directory
```

I have to use `gzcat` instead:

```
$ gzcat karma-police.txt.gz | head -n 2
Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths
```

Using `zcat` or `gzcat` is the same as using `gunzip -c`. The `-c` flag means that the output will go to the standard output stream, leaving files intact.

```
$ gunzip -c karma-police.txt.gz | head -n 4 | tail -n 2
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
```

In turn, using `gunzip` is the same as using `gzip -d`. Instead of having to guess if the system I am currently logged into uses `zcat` or `gzcat`, I can just use:

```
$ gzip -dc karma-police.txt.gz | head -n 7 | tail -n 3
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is
Making me feel ill
```

For reading very long files comfortably, there is `zmore` and `zless`.

### Grep a compressed file

```
$ zgrep Karma karma-police.txt.gz
Karma police, arrest this man
Karma police, arrest this girl
Karma police
```

On Mac OS X, `zgrep` is equivalent to `grep -Z`.

## `.bz2`

`bzip2` is a compression/decompression tool using the Burrows–Wheeler algorithm. It deals with files with the extension `.bz2`.

### Compress a file

```
$ bzip2 -k paranoid-android.txt
```

Just as `gzip`, `bzip2` will remove input files if not told to keep them by using `-k`.

### Decompress a file

```
$ bzip2 -dk paranoid-android.txt.bz2
```

### Read a compressed file

Just as there is `gzcat` for reading `.gz` files, there is `bzcat` for reading `.bz2` files:

```
$ bzcat paranoid-android.txt.bz2 | head -n 2
Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
```

Using `bzcat` is equivalent to using `bunzip2 -c`:

```
$ bunzip2 -c paranoid-android.txt.bz2 | head -n 4 | tail -n 2
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
```

Using `bunzip2 -c` is equivalent to using `bzip2 -dc`:

```
$ bzip2 -dc paranoid-android.txt.bz2 | head -n 6 | tail -n 2
When I am king, you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
```

For reading very long files comfortably, there is `bzmore` and `bzless`.

### Grep a compressed file

```
$ bzgrep android paranoid-android.txt.bz2
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
```

On Mac OS X, `bzgrep` is equivalent to `grep -J`.

## Other tools

### Vim

You can open, read, edit and save `.gz` and `.bz2` files using Vim with no problems.

### Comparing files

For comparing compressed files, there are `zdiff` and `zcmp`, which are the equivalents of `diff` and `cmp`. On Linux, you can use them to compare `.gz` files. On Mac OS X, in theory, you could use them to compare many different compressed files, as this fragment of my `/usr/bin/zdiff` suggests:

```bash
#!/bin/sh -
check_suffix() {
  case "$1" in
  *[._-][Zz])
    setvar $2 "${1%??}"
    setvar $3 "gzip -cdqf"
    ;;
  *[._-]bz)
    setvar $2 "${1%???}"
    setvar $3 "bzip2 -cdqf"
    ;;
  *[._-]gz)
    setvar $2 "${1%???}"
    setvar $3 "gzip -cdqf"
    ;;
  # lots of different extensions omitted here
  esac
}
```

However, `setenv` is not a valid command in my `sh` and `zdiff` does not work at all:

```
$ zdiff karma-police.txt.gz karma-police-NO-FRIDGES.txt.gz
/usr/bin/zdiff: line 49: setvar: command not found
/usr/bin/zdiff: line 50: setvar: command not found
/usr/bin/zdiff: line 49: setvar: command not found
/usr/bin/zdiff: line 50: setvar: command not found
Binary files karma-police.txt.gz and karma-police-NO-FRIDGES.txt.gz differ
```

Fortunately, there is a different way to see that diff without recreating decompressed files:

```
$ diff <(gzip -dc karma-police.txt.gz) <(gzip -dc karma-police-NO-FRIDGES.txt.gz)
3c3
< He buzzes like a fridge
---
> He buzzes like a ******
```
