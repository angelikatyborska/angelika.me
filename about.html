<h1>Hello! My name is Angelika.</h1>
<p>I'm a junior Ruby developer located in Poznan, Poland. I started this blog to share my experiences with exploring Ruby, Rails, JavaScript and software development in general. I want to write posts that would have allowed last week me to save half the time she spent on researching a topic, if only I could go back in time and make her read them.</p>

<p>If there is something wrong with my blog, please let me know by <a href="{{ site.about.repo }}/issues">creating an issue on GitHub</a>. </p>
