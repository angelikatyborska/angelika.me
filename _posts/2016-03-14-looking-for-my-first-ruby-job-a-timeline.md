I would like to share with you my experience with looking for my first Ruby job. I want to focus mainly on the timeline of the whole process. Before I started, I was under the impression that everyone would answer my emails within 24 hours. This post is to let you know how wrong I was and how tedious the recruitment process can be.

## Prologue - A kick in the butt

I had been wanting to work for Company X ever since I have heard their employee give a short presentation at my university about how awesome Ruby and Rails are, in October 2014. This guy knew how to deliver a presentation. He was natural, well-spoken and relaxed. I was sold. I wanted to be like him. I decided to learn Ruby and Rails. Fast-forward 14 months...

**11-12 December 2015:** I attended a RoR workshop at Company X (required for an internship).

**19 December 2015:** I applied for an internship at Company X.

**29 December 2015:** Company X rejected me (with feedback).

I was not prepared for a failure. In fact, I hadn't experienced many big failures up until that point of my life. This rejection was very important to me. It motivated me to start working really hard on a portfolio app (after two or three days of self-pity). 

## Part I - Portfolio ready, time to start applying

**04 February 2016:** I applied for a junior position at Company A in a response to a job offer.

**08 February 2016:** Company A asked me for patience saying they were extremely busy and they will not get back to me for another week at least.

**09 February 2016:** I applied for a junior position at Company B in a response to a job offer that has been on their website forever.

A whole week of silence.

## Part II - Slowly losing my mind

Why wasn't anyone replying? I triple-checked my resume, the email address was correct, my phone number was correct. I triple-checked my sent mailbox - the applications were there. I assumed I was silently rejected and sent more applications. Sadly, there were no more junior positions available in my city at that time.

**16 February 2016:** I applied for a position (level not specified) at Company C in a response to a job offer with a deadline (29 February 2016).

**16 February 2016:** I applied for a position (level not specified) at Company D in a response to a job offer.

3 more days of silence.

## Part III - Some replies, at last

**19 February 2016:** Company A asked me to do a recruitment task.

**19 February 2016:** Company B rejected me saying that they do not plan to expand their team in the nearest future, but will keep my resume around in case there is a new project requiring someone with my skills.

**23 February 2016:** I sent the recruitment task back to Company A.

## Part IV - Resolution

**26 February 2016:** Company A wanted to do a Skype interview.

**01 March 2016:** Company C rejected me due to lack of experience (it turned out to be a mid position). They offered to keep my resume around and gave me a coding test, so that they can immediately invite me to an interview when they need a junior. I passed the test.

**01 March 2016:** I had a Skype interview with Company A's developers.

**03 March 2016:** I had a Skype interview with Company A's management. We agreed on a date to sign the contract.

**07 March 2016:** I signed the contract with Company A.

## Epilogue - A new beginning

**14 March 2016:** I started working for Company A.

## Conclusion

IT companies treat job applicants well. They don't leave you hanging. I got a response from **4 out of 5** companies. The number of days it took the companies to send me the first reply in ascending order: 4, 10, 10 and 14 (but it was right on time after the deadline). That's an average of **9.5 days**. Between sending the resume and the first day of work **39 days** have passed. It would have taken much longer if I weren't ready to start working right away.

There isn't that many candidates to choose form when it comes to recruitment in software development, so employers want you to have a positive memory of them. You might not be suitable for the position they're offering right now, but after 2-3 years you might be the perfect candidate and when that happens, they want you to want them. You should adapt a similar strategy. Do not burn bridges. If someone gives you negative feedback, don't argue. Be polite and thank them, they want you to become a better developer.

Be patient and don't obsess over one application. Keep sending resumes, but more importantly, keep improving yourself.
