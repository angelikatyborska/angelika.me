<h1>Hello! My name is Angelika.</h1>

<p>I'm a junior web developer located in Poznan, Poland. I work with Ruby, Elixir and JavaScript and enjoy them all. Writing this blog is a means of organizing my thoughts about new concepts, problems, and tools that I encounter while learning software development.</p>

<p>Want to chat?</p>
