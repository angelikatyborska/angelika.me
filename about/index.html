<h1>Hello! My name is Angelika.</h1>
<p>I'm a junior web developer located in Poznan, Poland. I work with Ruby and JavaScript and enjoy them both. Writing this blog is a means of organizing my thoughts about new concepts, problems, and tools that I encounter while learning software development.</p>
