    <p>Hi! My name is <span lang="pl">Angelika Tyborska</span> and I'm a web developer located in Berlin, Germany.</p>

    <p>I currently work for <a href="https://steadyhq.com">Steady Media</a>, where I help build a membership platform for independent content creators.</p>

    <p>I write this blog to document and share my experiences with various challenges that I encounter writing software.
      I am by no means an expert, so please take my posts with a healthy dose of skepticism, and make sure to leave a comment
      if you have constructive feedback.</p>

<h3>Personal</h3>

<p>I was born in <span lang="pl">Gorzów Wielkopolski</span>, Poland, and spent my early 20s in <span lang="pl">Poznań</span>, Poland.
  I moved to Berlin, Germany in 2017 to pursue love for a man, and ended up falling in love with the city as well.</p>

{% asset about/poland alt:"A map of Poland showing a route from Gorzów, to Poznań, to Berlin. All those cities are less than 300km from one another." class='poland' %}

<p>To relax after a long week of coding, I like to spend a few hours over a complex strategy board game,
  or silly party board games. To manage stress and stay healthy, I like to spend my mornings at the gym, lifting weights.</p>

{% asset about/hobbies alt:'' aria-hidden='true' class='hobbies' %}

<p>I care deeply about reducing animal suffering, but
  I haven't figured out yet how to sustainably and productively use my software development skills to do that. Let me know if you have any ideas.</p>
